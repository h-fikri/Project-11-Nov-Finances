# Project-11-Nov-Finances

Javascript Finances

## Link to Deployed GitHub Pages:

## The Challenges are:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
  solution => use array.length

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  => use specific index and total the index?

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  - (`Total/Number of months`)
    => basic calculation

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Evaluation

- During this exercise, I learnt a massive amount of Javascript Basic array manipulation and indexing, that is how to locate or pinpoint data inside an multi-dimensional array.
- It was quite challenging and made my head spinning a lot. But eventually, I got through it.
